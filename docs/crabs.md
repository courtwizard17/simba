## Requirements
- Children of the Sun Quest [1]

1: The quest is very short, and very easy.

## Features:

### Supports all combat levels

The script lets you choose how many crabs you want to be attacked by at the same time.
If you only add the single-crab spawns, you can start using the script at level 3 without issues.
Low level pures might want to use the double-crab spawns. For high-level accounts it is recommended to
use both triple and quadruple spawns. The script does not spend time hopping worlds, so it is more efficient
to just add the triple spots and use them, if you get crashed in the quadruple spots.


The theoretical maximum xp per hour caps at around 100 k with the quadruple spot.

### Supports all combat styles

Melee, Magic and Ranged, all supported. The script will log out if you run out of arrows or runes.

### Eats food and optionally drinks potions.

Set them up in the GUI, and have 4-dose potions and your chosen food at the top of your bank.
